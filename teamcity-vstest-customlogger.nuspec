    <summary>A TeamCity custom logger for VSTest.Console.exe that supports real-time test reporting</summary>
    <description>
VSTest.Console supports custom loggers, i.e. libraries that can handle events that occur when tests are being executed.
TeamCity 9.0+ has a custom logger that provides real-time test reporting.
The logger must be installed manually on the agent machine, as it requires dlls to be copied to the Extensions folder of the VSTest.Console. No agent restart is needed when the custom logger is installed.
